<p>In the existing market when a book is published, there is a high chance that the user’s or the reader’s interest is not taken into consideration. 
     This results in less success of published books, or publishers not ready to support an author which waste money and time. </p>
<p>Our proposed system is a global website, in which authors post their stories or their works. 
     These works are viewed and read by fellow authors or reader, and upon reading they review the book. 
     If the reviews regarding a book is favorable, the system connects them with a publisher. 
     It will also help the user to know the recent launched books that match up with their interests and are introduced into the market like fiction, science, technology etc.</p>
<p> All the feedbacks about a book will be taken into consideration, before connecting with a publisher. The books uploaded will be categorized according to genre. 
     This helps readers to find genre they like easier.</p>
